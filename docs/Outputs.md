Page\: `Setup -> Output`

For a full list of supported Outputs, see [Supported Outputs Devices](Supported-Outputs.md).

Outputs are various signals that can be generated that operate devices. An output can be a HIGH/LOW signal on a GPIO pin, a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal, a 315/433 MHz signal to switch a radio frequency-operated relay, driving of pumps and motors, or an execution of a linux or Python command, to name a few.

## Custom Outputs

There is a Custom Output import system in Farm that allows user-created Outputs to be created an used in the Farm system. Custom Outputs can be uploaded and imported from the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Outputs` page. After import, they will be available to use on the `Setup -> Output` page.

If you develop a working Output module, please consider [creating a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=New%20Module) or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set.

Open any of the built-in modules located in the directory [Farm/farm/outputs](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/outputs/) for examples of the proper formatting.

There are also example Custom Outputs in the directory [Farm/farm/outputs/examples](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/functions/examples)

Additionally, I have another github repository devoted to Custom Modules that are not included in the built-in set, at [mir-one/Farm-custom](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm-custom).

For Outputs that require new measurements/units, they can be added on the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Measurements` page.

## On/Off (GPIO)

The On/Off (GPIO) output merely turns a GPIO pin High (3.3 volts) or Low (0 volts). This is useful for controlling things like electromechanical switches, such as relays, to turn electrical devices on and off.

Relays are electromechanical or solid-state devices that enable a small voltage signal (such as from a microprocessor) to activate a much larger voltage, without exposing the low-voltage system to the dangers of the higher voltage.

Add and configure outputs in the Output tab. Outputs must be properly set up before they can be used in the rest of the system.

To set up a wired relay, set the "GPIO Pin" (using BCM numbering) to the pin you would like to switch High (5 volts) and Low (0 volts), which can be used to activate relays and other devices. *On Trigger* should be set to the signal state (High or Low) that induces the device to turn on. For example, if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 0-volts, set *On Trigger* to "Low", otherwise if your relay activates when the potential across the coil is 5 volts, set it to "High".

## Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique used to encode a message into a pulsing signal, at a specific frequency in Hertz (Hz). The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load.

The PWM switching frequency has to be much higher than what would affect the load (the device that uses the power), which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application, for example

!!! quote
    Switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies.

The term duty cycle describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, with 0% being always off, 50% being off for half of the time and on for half of the time, and 100% being always on.

### Non-hardware PWM Pins

When using non-hardware PWM pins, there are only certain frequencies that can be used. These frequencies in Hertz are 40000, 20000, 10000, 8000, 5000, 4000, 2500, 2000, 1600, 1250, 1000, 800, 500, 400, 250, 200, 100, and 50 Hz. If you attempt to set a frequency that is not listed here, the nearest frequency from this list will be used.

### Hardware PWM Pins

The exact frequency may be set when using hardware PWM pins. The same PWM channel is available on multiple GPIO. The latest frequency and duty cycle setting will be used by all GPIO pins which share a PWM channel.

## Peristaltic Pump

There are two peristaltic pump Output modules that Farm supports, a generic peristaltic pump Output, and the Atlas Scientific EZO-PMP peristaltic pump.

### Generic Peristaltic Pump

Any peristaltic pump can be used with the Generic Peristaltic Pump Output to dispense liquids. The most basic dispensing abilities are to start dispensing, stop dispensing, or dispense for a duration of time. If the pump rate has been measured, this value can be entered into the Fastest Rate (ml/min) setting and the Output controller will then be able to dispense specific volumes rather than merely for durations of time. In oder to dispense specific volumes, the Output Mode will also need to be set in addition to the Desired Flow Rate (ml/min), if the Output Mode has been set to Specify Flow Rate.

To determine your pump's flow rate, first purge all air from your pump's hose. Next, instruct the pump to dispense for 60 seconds and collect the liquid it dispenses. Once finished, measure the amount of liquid and enter this value, in milliliters into the Fastest Rate (ml/min) setting. Once your pump's flow rate is set, you can now start dispensing specific volumes rather than durations.

This Output module relies on switching a GPIO pin High and Low to switch the peristaltic pump on and off. This is most easily accomplished with the use of a relay in-line with your pump's power supply or using the GPIO as an input signal directly to the pump (if supported). When using a relay, it's important to develop your circuit to provide the fastest possible switching of the pump. Since the volume dispensed by the pump is dependent on time, the faster the pump switching can occur, the more accurate the dispensing will be. Many peristaltic pumps operate on DC voltage and require an AC-DC converter. These converters can take a significant amount of time to energize once power is applied as well as de-energize once power is removed, causing significant delays that can impact dispensing accuracy. To alleviate this issue, the DC power should be switched, rather than the AC power, which will remove this potential delay.

### Atlas Scientific Peristaltic Pump

The Atlas Scientific peristaltic pump is a peristaltic pump and microcontroller combined that allows it to be communicated with via I2C or Serial and can accurately dispense specific volumes of fluid. There are [several commands](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/files/EZO_PMP_Datasheet.pdf) the pump can accept, including commands to calibrate, turn on, turn off, and dispense at a specific rate, among others. Atlas Scientific peristaltic pumps are good options, but are more expensive than generic peristaltic pumps.

## Wireless 315/433 MHz

Certain 315/433 MHz wireless relays may be used, however you will need to set the pin of the transmitter (using BCM numbering), pulse length, bit length, protocol, on command, and off command. To determine your On and Off commands, connect a 315/433 MHz receiver to your Pi, then run the receiver script, below, replacing 17 with the pin your receiver is connected to (using BCM numbering), and press one of the buttons on your remote (either on or off) to detect the numeric code associated with that button.

```bash
sudo ~/Farm/env/bin/python ~/Farm/farm/devices/wireless_rpi_rf.py -d 2 -g 17
```

433 MHz wireless relays have been successfully tested with SMAKN 433MHz RF Transmitters/Receivers and Etekcity Wireless Remote Control Electrical Outlets (see [Issue 88](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/issues/88) for more information). If you have a 315/433 MHz transmitter/receiver and a wireless relay that does not work with the current code, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/issues/new) with details of your hardware.

## Linux Command

Another option for output control is to execute a terminal command when the output is turned on, off, or a duty cycle is set. Commands will be executed as the user 'root'. When a Linux Command output is created, example code is provided to demonstrate how to use the output.

## Python Command

The Python Command output operates similarly to the Linux Command output, however Python 3 code is being executed. When a Python Command output is created, example code is provided to demonstrate how to use the output.

## Output Notes

Wireless and Command (Linux/Python) Outputs: Since the wireless protocol only allows 1-way communication to 315/433 MHz devices, wireless relays are assumed to be off until they are turned on, and therefore will appear red (off) when added. If a wireless relay is turned off or on outside Farm (by a remote, for instance), Farm will **\*not**\* be able to determine the state of the relay and will indicate whichever state the relay was last. This is, if Farm turns the wireless relay on, and a remote is used to turn the relay off, Farm will still assume the relay is on.

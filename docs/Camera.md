Cameras can be used to capture still images, create time-lapses, and stream video. Cameras may also be used by Functions to trigger a camera image or video capture.

There are several libraries that may be used to access your camera, which includes picamera (Raspberry Pi Camera), fswebcam, opencv, urllib, and requests (among potentially others). These libraries enable images to be acquired from the Raspberry Pi camera, USB cameras and webcams, and IP cameras that are accessible by a URL. Furthermore, using the urllib and request libraries, any image URL can be used to acquire images.

Alerts can be used to notify users about the state of the system. For things like sensor monitoring, this could be a threshold that indicates something needs attention. E-Mail notifications are built-in to Farm in a number of places, however there are several places (Inputs, Outputs, Controllers) that allow custom Python code to be used, enabling many other notification options to be built.

See [Alert Settings](Configuration-Settings.md#alert-settings) for more information about setting up Alerts.

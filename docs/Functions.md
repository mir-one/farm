Page\: `Setup -> Function`

For a full list of supported Inputs, see [Supported Functions](Supported-Functions.md).

Function controllers perform tasks that often involve the use of Inputs and Outputs.

!!! note
    "Last" means the Function will only acquire the last (latest) measurement in the database. "Past" means the Function will acquire all measurements from the present until the "Max Age (seconds)" that's been set (e.g. if measurements are acquired every 10 seconds, and a Max Age is set to 60 seconds, there will on average be 6 measurements returned to the Function to operate with).

## Custom Functions

There is a Custom Function import system in Farm that allows user-created Functions to be used in the Farm system. Custom Functions can be uploaded on the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Functions` page. After import, they will be available to use on the `Setup -> Function` page.

If you develop a working Function module, please consider [creating a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=New%20Module) or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set.

Open any of the built-in modules located in the directory [Farm/farm/functions](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/functions/) for examples of the proper formatting.

There are also example Custom Functions in the directory [Farm/farm/functions/examples](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/functions/examples)

Additionally, I have another github repository devoted to Custom Modules that are not included in the built-in set, at [mir-one/Farm-custom](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm-custom).

For Functions that require new measurements/units, they can be added on the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Measurements` page.

## PID Controller

A [proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism used throughout industry for controlling systems. It efficiently brings a measurable condition, such as the temperature, to a desired state and maintains it there with little overshoot and oscillation. A well-tuned PID controller will raise to the setpoint quickly, have minimal overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with little oscillation.

PID settings may be changed while the PID is activated and the new settings will take effect immediately. If settings are changed while the controller is paused, the values will be used once the controller resumes operation.

### PID Output Calculation

PID Controllers can control a number of different output types (e.g. duration, volume, or PWM duty cycle). For most output types, the PID output (Control Variable) will be proportional (i.e. ``Output Duration = PID Control Variable``). However, when outputting a duty cycle, it will be calculated as ``Duty Cycle = (Control Variable / Period) * 100``.

!!! note
    Control Variable = P Output + I Output + D Output. Duty cycle is limited within the 0 - 100 % range and the set Min Duty Cycle and Max Duty Cycle. An output duration is limited by the set Min On Duration and Max On Duration, and output volume similarly.

### PID Tuning

PID tuning can be a complex process, depending on the output device(s) used and the environment or system under control. A system with large perturbations will be more difficult to control than one that is stable. Similarly, output devices that are unsuitable may make PID tuning difficult or impossible. Learning how PID controllers operate and the theory behind their tuning will not only better prepare you to operate a PID controller, but also in the development of your system and selection and implementation of the output devices used to regulate your system. 

#### PID Tuning Resources

#### PID Control Theory

The PID controller is the most common regulatory controller found in industrial settings, for it"s ability to handle both simple and complex regulation. The PID controller has three paths, the proportional, integral, and derivative.

The **P**roportional takes the error and multiplies it by the constant K<sub>P</sub>, to yield an output value. When the error is large, there will be a large proportional output.

The **I**ntegral takes the error and multiplies it by K<sub>I</sub>, then integrates it (K<sub>I</sub> Â· 1/s). As the error changes over time, the integral will continually sum it and multiply it by the constant K<sub>I</sub>. The integral is used to remove perpetual error in the control system. If using K<sub>P</sub> alone produces an output that produces a perpetual error (i.e. if the sensor measurement never reaches the Set Point), the integral will increase the output until the error decreases and the Set Point is reached.

The **D**erivative multiplies the error by K<sub>D</sub>, then differentiates it (K<sub>D</sub> Â· s). When the error rate changes over time, the output signal will change. The faster the change in error, the larger the derivative path becomes, decreasing the output rate of change. This has the effect of dampening overshoot and undershoot (oscillation) of the Set Point.

![PID Animation](images/PID-Animation.gif)

The K<sub>P</sub>, K<sub>I</sub>, and K<sub>D</sub> gains determine how much each of the P, I, and D variables influence the final PID output value. For instance, the greater the value of the gain, the more influence that variable has on the output.

![PID Equation](images/PID-Equation.jpg)

The output from the PID controller can be used in a number of ways. A simple use is to use this value as the number of seconds an output is turned on during a periodic interval (Period). For instance, if the Period is set to 30 seconds, the PID equation has the desired measurement and the actual measurement used to calculate the PID output every 30 seconds. The more the output is on during this period, the more it will affect the system. For example, an output on for 15 seconds every 30 seconds is at a 50 % duty cycle, and would affect the system roughly half as much as when the output is on for 30 seconds every 30 seconds, or at at 100 % duty cycle. The PID controller will calculate the output based on the amount of error (how far the actual measurement is from the desired measurement). If the error increases or persists, the output increases, causing the output to turn on for a longer duration within the Period, which usually in term causes the measured condition to change and the error to reduce. When the error reduces, the control variable decreases, meaning the output is turned on for a shorter duration of time. The ultimate goal of a well-tuned PID controller is to bring the actual measurement to the desired measurement quickly, with little overshoot, and maintain the setpoint with minimal oscillation.

* * * * *

Using temperature as an example, the Process Variable (PV) is the measured temperature, the Setpoint (SP) is the desired temperature, and the Error (e) is the distance between the measured temperature and the desired temperature (indicating if the actual temperature is too hot or too cold and to what degree). The error is manipulated by each of the three PID components, producing an output, called the Manipulated Variable (MV) or Control Variable (CV). To allow control of how much each path contributes to the output value, each path is multiplied by a gain (represented by K<sub>P</sub>, K<sub>I</sub>, and K<sub>D</sub>). By adjusting the gains, the sensitivity of the system to each path is affected. When all three paths are summed, the PID output is produced. If a gain is set to 0, that path does not contribute to the output and that path is essentially turned off.

The output can be used a number of ways, however this controller was designed to use the output to affect the measured value (PV). This feedback loop, with a *properly tuned* PID controller, can achieve a set point in a short period of time, maintain regulation with little oscillation, and respond quickly to disturbance.

Therefor, if one would be regulating temperature, the sensor would be a temperature sensor and the feedback device(s) would be able to heat and cool. If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the output value would be positive and a heater would activate. The temperature would rise toward the desired temperature, causing the error to decrease and a lower output to be produced. This feedback loop would continue until the error reaches 0 (at which point the output would be 0). If the temperature continues to rise past the Set Point (this is may be acceptable, depending on the degree), the PID would produce a negative output, which could be used by the cooling device to bring the temperature back down, to reduce the error. If the temperature would normally lower without the aid of a cooling device, then the system can be simplified by omitting a cooler and allowing it to lower on its own.

Implementing a controller that effectively utilizes K<sub>P</sub>, K<sub>I</sub>, and K<sub>D</sub> can be challenging. Furthermore, it is often unnecessary. For instance, the K<sub>I</sub> and K<sub>D</sub> can be set to 0, effectively turning them off and producing the very popular and simple P controller. Also popular is the PI controller. It is recommended to start with only K<sub>P</sub> activated, then experiment with K<sub>P</sub> and K<sub>I</sub>, before finally using all three. Because systems will vary (e.g. airspace volume, degree of insulation, and the degree of impact from the connected device, etc.), each path will need to be adjusted through experimentation to produce an effective output.

#### Quick Setup Examples

These example setups are meant to illustrate how to configure regulation in particular directions, and not to achieve ideal values to configure your K<sub>P</sub>, K<sub>I</sub>, and K<sub>D</sub> gains. There are a number of online resources that discuss techniques and methods that have been developed to determine ideal PID values (such as [here](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/167/what-are-good-strategies-for-tuning-pid-loops), [here](http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-pid-loops), [here](https://hennulat.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/pid-loop-tuning-101/), [here](http://eas.uccs.edu/wang/ECE4330F12/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf), and [here](http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2558.pdf)) and since there are no universal values that will work for every system, it is recommended to conduct your own research to understand the variables and essential to conduct your own experiments to effectively implement them.

Provided merely as an example of the variance of PID values, one of my setups had temperature PID values (up regulation) of K<sub>P</sub> = 30, K<sub>I</sub> = 1.0, and K<sub>D</sub> = 0.5, and humidity PID values (up regulation) of K<sub>P</sub> = 1.0, K<sub>I</sub> = 0.2, and K<sub>D</sub> = 0.5. Furthermore, these values may not have been optimal but they worked well for the conditions of my environmental chamber.

#### Exact Temperature Regulation

This will set up the system to raise and lower the temperature to a certain level with two regulatory devices (one that heats and one that cools).

Add a sensor, then save the proper device and pin/address for each sensor and activate the sensor.

Add two outputs, then save each GPIO and On Trigger state.

Add a PID, then select the newly-created sensor. Change *Setpoint* to the desired temperature, *Regulate Direction* to "Both". Set *Raise Output* to the relay attached to the heating device and the *Lower Relay* to the relay attached to the cooling device.

Set K<sub>P</sub> = 1, K<sub>I</sub> = 0, and K<sub>D</sub> = 0, then activate the PID.

If the temperature is lower than the Set Point, the heater should activate at some interval determined by the PID controller until the temperature rises to the set point. If the temperature goes higher than the Set Point (or Set Point + Buffer), the cooling device will activate until the temperature returns to the set point. If the temperature is not reaching the Set Point after a reasonable amount of time, increase the K<sub>P</sub> value and see how that affects the system. Experiment with different configurations involving only *Read Interval* and K<sub>P</sub> to achieve a good regulation. Avoid changing the K<sub>I</sub> and K<sub>D</sub> from 0 until a working regulation is achieved with K<sub>P</sub> alone.

View graphs in the 6 to 12 hour time span to identify how well the temperature is regulated to the Setpoint. What is meant by well-regulated will vary, depending on your specific application and tolerances. Most applications of a PID controller would like to see the proper temperature attained within a reasonable amount of time and with little oscillation around the Setpoint.

Once regulation is achieved, experiment by reducing K<sub>P</sub> slightly (~25%) and increasing K<sub>I</sub> by a low amount to start, such as 0.1 (or lower, 0.01), then start the PID and observe how well the controller regulates. Slowly increase K<sub>I</sub> until regulation becomes both quick and with little oscillation. At this point, you should be fairly familiar with experimenting with the system and the K<sub>D</sub> value can be experimented with once both K<sub>P</sub> and K<sub>I</sub> have been tuned.

#### High Temperature Regulation

Often the system can be simplified if two-way regulation is not needed. For instance, if cooling is unnecessary, this can be removed from the system and only up-regulation can be used.

Use the same configuration as the [Exact Temperature Regulation](Functions.md#exact-temperature-regulation) example, except change *Regulate Direction* to "Raise" and do not touch the "Down Relay" section.

## PID Autotune

!!! warning
    This is an experimental feature. It is best not used until you are familiar with the theory, operation, and tuning of a PID.

The Autotune function is a standalone controller that is useful for determining appropriate Kp, Ki, and Kd gains for use in the a PID controller. The autotuner will manipulate an output and analyze the measured response in a particular environment/system. It will take several cycles of perturbing the system with the chosen output before enough data is available to calculate the PID gains. In order to use this feature, select a Measurement and an Output that can module the specific condition being measured. Then, configure the Noise Band and Outstep and activate the function. Log lines of the autotuner will appear in the daemon log (`[Gear Icon] -> Farm Logs -> Daemon Log`). While the autotune is being performed, it is recommended to create a dashboard graph that includes the Measurement and Output in order to see what the PID Autotuner is doing and to notice any potential issues with the autotune settings that have been configured. If the autotune is taking a long time to complete, there may not be enough stability in the system being manipulated to calculate a reliable set of PID gains. This may be because there are too many perturbations to the system, or conditions are changing too rapidly to acquire consistent measurement oscillations. If this is the case, try modifying your system to increase stability and yield consistent measurement oscillations. Once the autotune successfully completes, perturbations may be reintroduced in order to further tune the PID controller to handle them.

## Conditional

Conditional controllers are used to perform certain [Actions](Functions.md#function-actions) based a user-generated Conditional Statement.

### Conditional Options

### Conditional Setup Guide

Python 3 is the environment that these conditionals will be executed. The following functions can be used within your Conditional Statement code.

!!! note
    Python code indentations must use 4 spaces (not 2 spaces, tabs, or anything else).

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Function</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>self.condition(&quot;{ID}&quot;)</td>
<td>Returns a measurement for the Condition with ID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>self.condition_dict(&quot;{ID}&quot;)</td>
<td>Returns a dictionary of measurement for the Condition with ID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>self.run_action(&quot;{ID}&quot;)</td>
<td>Executes the Action with ID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>self.run_all_actions()</td>
<td>Executes all actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>self.logger.info()</td>
<td>Writes a log line to the Daemon log. "info" may also be changed to "warning", "error" or "debug". Debug log lines will only appear in the Daemon log when Logging Level: Debug is enabled for the Input.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>self.set_custom_option("option", value)</td>
<td>Writes the value to the database for retrieval later. The option argument should be a string, and value can be a string, integer, float, list, or dictionary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>self.get_custom_option("option")</td>
<td>Reads the value from the database that was previously written with self.set_custom_option(). Returns None if the option is not found or there is no value.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

There are additional functions that can be used, but these must use the full UUID (not an abridged version as the functions above). See /home/pi/Farm/farm/farm_client.py for the functions available for use. These may be accessed via the 'control' object. An example, below, will return how long the output has been on (or 0 if it's currently off):

`output_on_seconds = control.output_sec_currently_on("1b6ada50-1e69-403a-9fa6-ec748b16dc23")`

Since the Python code contained in the Conditional Statement must be formatted properly, it's best to familiarize yourself with the [basics of Python](https://realpython.com/python-conditional-statements/).

!!! note
    There are two different IDs in use here, one set of IDs are found under the `Conditions` section of the Conditional Controller, and one set of IDs are found under the `Actions` section of the Conditional Controller. Read all of this section, including the examples, below, to fully understand how to properly set up a Conditional Controller.

!!! info
    If a measurement hasn't been acquired within the set `Max Age`, "None" will be returned when self.condition("{ID}") is called in the code. It is very important that you account for this. All examples below incorporate a test for the measurement being None, and this should not be removed. If an error occurs (such as if the statement resolves to comparing None to a numerical value, such as "if None < 23"), then the code will stop there and an error will be logged in the daemon log. Accounting for None is useful for determining if an Input is no longer acquiring measurements (e.g. dead sensor, malfunction, etc.).

To create a basic conditional, follow these steps, using the numbers in the screenshots, below, that correspond to the numbers in parentheses:

-   Navigate to the `Setup -> Function` page.
-   Select "Controller: Conditional", then click `Add`.
-   Under Conditions (1), select a condition option, then click `Add Condition`.
-   Configure the newly-added Condition then click `Save`.
-   Under Actions (2), select an action option, then click `Add Action`.
-   Configure the newly-added Action then click `Save`.
-   Notice that each Condition and each Action has its own ID (underlined).
-   The default Conditional Statement (3) contains placeholder IDs that need to be changed to your Condition and Action IDs. Change the ID in self.condition("{asdf1234}") to your Condition ID. Change the ID in self.run_action("{qwer5678}", message=message) to your Action ID. Click `Save` at the top of the Conditional.
-   The logic used in the Conditional Statement will need to be adjusted to suit your particular needs. Additionally, you may add more Conditions or Actions. See the `Advanced Conditional Statement examples`, below, for usage examples.

If your `Conditional Statement` has been formatted correctly, your Conditional will save and it will be ready to activate. If an error is returned, your options will not have been saved. Inspect the error for which line is causing the issue and read the error message itself to try to understand what the problem is and how to fix it. There are an unfathomable number of ways to configure a Conditional, but this should hopefully get you started to developing one that suits your needs.

!!! note
    Farm is constantly changing, so the screenshots below may not match what you see exactly. Be sure to read this entire section of the manual to understand how to use Conditional Controllers.

![Figure-Farm-Conditional-Setup](images/Figure-Farm-Conditional-Setup.png)

Beginner `Conditional Statement` examples:

Each self.condition("{ID}") will return the most recent measurement obtained from that particular measurement under the `Conditions` section of the Conditional Controller, as long as it's within the set Max Age.

```python
# Example 1, no measurement (i.e. None) returned
# useful with the Email Notify Action to email when an Input stops working
if self.condition("{asdf1234}") is None:
    self.run_all_actions()  # Execute all configured actions

# Example 2, test two measurement conditions
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    # If neither measurement is None (both are working)
    if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
        # If measure_1 is less than 20 and measure_2 is greater than 10
        self.run_all_actions()  # Execute all configured actions

# Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    sum_ = measure_1 + measure_2
    if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum_ < 30.5:
        self.run_all_actions()

# Example 4, combine into one conditional
measurement = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
if measurement is not None and 20 < measurement < 30:  # combine conditions
    self.run_all_actions()

# Example 5, test two measurements
# convert Edge Input from 0 or 1 to True or False
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    if bool(measure_1) and measure_2 > 10:
        self.run_all_actions()

# Example 6, test measurement with "or" and a rounded measurement
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    if measure_1 > 20 or int(round(measure_2)) in [20, 21, 22]:
        self.run_all_actions()

# Example 7, use self to store variables across multiple executions
measurement = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
if not hasattr(self, "stored_measurement"):  # Initialize variable
    self.stored_measurement = measurement
if measurement is not None:
    if abs(measurement - self.stored_measurement) > 10:
        self.run_all_actions()  # if difference is greater than 10
    self.stored_measurement = measurement  # Store measurement
```

The "Measurement (Multiple)" Condition is useful if you desire to check if a particular value has been stored in any of the past measurements (within the set Max Age), not just the last measurement. This is useful if you have an alert system that each numerical value represents a different alert that you need to check each past value if it occurred. Here is an example that retrieves all measurements from the past 30 minutes and checks if any of the measurements in the returned list is equal to "119". If "119" exists, the Actions are executed and `break` is used to exit the `for` loop.

```python
# Example 1, find a measurement in the past 30 minutes (Max Age: 1800 seconds)
measurements = self.condition_dict("{asdf1234}")
if measurements:  # If the list is not empty
    for each_measure in measurements:  # Loop through each measurement in the list
        if each_measure['value'] == 119:
            self.logger.info("Alert 119 found at timestamp {time}".format(
                time=each_measure['time']))
            self.run_all_actions()
            break  # Exit the for loop
```

Advanced `Conditional Statement` examples:

These examples expand on the beginner examples, above, by activating specific actions. The following examples will reference actions with IDs that can be found under the `Actions` section of the Conditional Controller. Two example action IDs will be used: "qwer1234" and "uiop5678". Additionally, self.run_all_actions() is used here, which will run all actions in the order in which they were created.

```python
# Example 1
measurement = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
if measurement is None:
    self.run_action("{qwer1234}")
elif measurement > 23:
    self.run_action("{uiop5678}")
else:
    self.run_all_actions()

# Example 2, test two measurements
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
        self.run_action("{qwer1234}")
        self.run_action("{uiop5678}")

# Example 3, test two measurements and sum of measurements
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    sum_ = measure_1 + measure_2
    if measure_1 > 2 and 10 < measure_2 < 23 and sum_ < 30.5:
        self.run_action("{qwer1234}")
    else:
        self.run_action("{uiop5678}")

# Example 4, combine into one conditional
measurement = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
if measurement is not None and 20 < measurement < 30:
    self.run_action("{uiop5678}")

# Example 5, test two measurements, convert Edge Input from 0/1 to True/False
measure_1 = self.condition("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.condition("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    if bool(measure_1) and measure_2 > 10:
        self.run_all_actions()

# Example 6, test measurement with "or" and a rounded measurement
measure_1 = self.measure("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.measure("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    if measure_1 > 20 or int(round(measure_2)) in [20, 21, 22]:
        self.run_action("{qwer1234}")
        if measure_1 > 30:
            self.run_action("{uiop5678}")
```

If your Action is a type that receives a message (E-Mail or Note), you can modify this message to include extra information before it is passed to the function (so the new information is passed to the Note, E-Mail, etc.). To do this, append a string to the variable `self.message` and add this to the `message` parameter of self.run_action() or self.run_all_actions(). Below are some examples. Note the use of "+=" instead of "=", which appends the string to the variable `self.message` instead of overwriting it.

```python
# Example 1
measurement = self.measure("{asdf1234}")
if measurement is None and measurement > 23:
    self.message += "Measurement was {}".format(measurement)
    self.run_action("{uiop5678}", message=self.message)

# Example 2
measure_1 = self.measure("{asdf1234}")
measure_2 = self.measure("{hjkl5678}")
if None not in [measure_1, measure_2]:
    if measure_1 < 20 and measure_2 > 10:
        self.message += "Measurement 1: {m1}, Measurement 2: {m2}".format(
            m1=measure_1, m2=measure_2)
        self.run_all_actions(message=self.message)
```

Logging can also be used to log messages to the daemon log using `self.logger`. Logging levels include "info", "warning", "error" and "debug". Debug log lines will only appear in the Daemon log when Logging Level: Debug is enabled for the Input.

```python
# Example 1
measurement = self.measure("{asdf1234}")
if measurement is None and measurement > 23:
    self.logging.error("Warning, measurement was {}".format(measurement))
    self.message += "Measurement was {}".format(measurement)
    self.run_action("{uiop5678}", message=self.message)
```

Before activating any conditionals, it's advised to thoroughly explore all possible scenarios and plan a configuration that eliminates conflicts. Some devices or outputs may respond atypically or fail when switched on and off in rapid succession. Therefore, trial run your configuration before connecting devices to any outputs.

## Trigger

A Trigger Controller will execute actions when events are triggered, such as an output turning on or off, a GPIO pin changing it's voltage state (Edge detection, rising or falling), timed events that include various timers (duration, time period, time point, etc), or the sunrise/sunset time at a specific latitude and longitude. Once the trigger is configured, add any number of [Actions](Functions.md#function-actions) to be executed when that event is triggered.

<td>Start Time (HH:MM)</td>
<td>Set the time to trigger Conditional Actions, in the format &quot;HH:MM&quot;, with HH denoting hours, and MM denoting minutes. Time is in 24-hour format.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Timer (Daily Time Span) Options

Run a timer that triggers Conditional Actions at a specific period if it's between the set start and end times. For example, if the Start Time is set to 10:00 and End Time set to 11:00 and Period set to 120 seconds, the Conditional Actions will trigger every 120 seconds when the time is between 10 AM and 11 AM.

This may be useful, for instance, if you desire an Output to remain on during a particular time period and you want to prevent power outages from interrupting the cycle (which a simple Time Point Timer could not prevent against because it only triggers once at the Start Time). By setting an Output to turn the lights on every few minutes during the Start -> End period, it ensured the Output remains on during this period.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Start Time (HH:MM)</td>
<td>Set the start time to trigger Conditional Actions, in the format &quot;HH:MM&quot;, with HH denoting hours, and MM denoting minutes. Time is in 24-hour format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>End Time (HH:MM)</td>
<td>Set the end time to trigger Conditional Actions, in the format &quot;HH:MM&quot;, with HH denoting hours, and MM denoting minutes. Time is in 24-hour format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Period (seconds)</td>
<td>The period of time between triggering Conditional Actions.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

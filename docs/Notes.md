Page\: `More -> Notes`

Notes may be created that can then be displayed on graphs or referenced at a later time. All notes are timestamped with the date/time of creation or may be created with a custom date/time. Each note must have at least one tag selected. Tags are what are selected to be displayed on a graph and all notes with that tag will appear in the time frame selected on the graph.

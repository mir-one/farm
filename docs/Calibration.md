Calibration can be performed for any Input, Output, or Function if that functionality has been built in to the module. Some common modules that have calibration are several of the Atlas Scientific, MH-Z19, and DS-type Inputs and many of the peristaltic pump Outputs. Calibration actions can be found on the options page for the particular device. Refer to the calibration instructions at this location for how to perform a successful calibration.

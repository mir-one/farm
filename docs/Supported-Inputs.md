A single topic is subscribed to and the returned JSON payload contains one or more key/value pairs. The given JSON Key is used as a JMESPATH expression to find the corresponding value that will be stored for that channel. Be sure you select and save the Measurement Unit for each channel. Once the unit has been saved, you can convert to other units in the Convert Measurement section. Example expressions for jmespath (https://jmespath.org) include <i>temperature</i>, <i>sensors[0].temperature</i>, and <i>bathroom.temperature</i> which refer to the temperature as a direct key within the first entry of sensors or as a subkey of bathroom, respectively. Jmespath elements and keys that contain special characters have to be enclosed in double quotes, e.g. <i>"sensor-1".temperature</i>.

##### The EZO-RGB color sensor is designed to be calibrated to a white object at the maximum brightness the object will be viewed under. In order to get the best results, Atlas Scientific strongly recommends that the sensor is mounted into a fixed location. Holding the sensor in your hand during calibration will decrease performance.<br>1. Embed the EZO-RGB color sensor into its intended use location.<br>2. Set LED brightness to the desired level.<br>3. Place a white object in front of the target object and press the Calibration button.<br>4. A single color reading will be taken and the device will be fully calibrated.

#### Actions

##### Calibration: a one- or two-point calibration can be performed. It's a good idea to clear the calibration before calibrating. Always perform a dry calibration with the probe in the air (not in any fluid). Then perform either a one- or two-point calibration with calibrated solutions. If performing a one-point calibration, use the Single Point Calibration field and button. If performing a two-point calibration, use the Low and High Point Calibration fields and buttons. Allow a minute or two after submerging your probe in a calibration solution for the measurements to equilibrate before calibrating to that solution. The EZO EC circuit default temperature compensation is set to 25 °C. If the temperature of the calibration solution is +/- 2 °C from 25 °C, consider setting the temperature compensation first. Note that at no point should you change the temperature compensation value during calibration. Therefore, if you have previously enabled temperature compensation, allow at least one measurement to occur (to set the compensation value), then disable the temperature compensation measurement while you calibrate.

#### Actions

##### Calibration: a one-, two- or three-point calibration can be performed. It's a good idea to clear the calibration before calibrating. The first calibration must be the Mid point. The second must be the Low point. And the third must be the High point. You can perform a one-, two- or three-point calibration, but they must be performed in this order. Allow a minute or two after submerging your probe in a calibration solution for the measurements to equilibrate before calibrating to that solution. The EZO pH circuit default temperature compensation is set to 25 °C. If the temperature of the calibration solution is +/- 2 °C from 25 °C, consider setting the temperature compensation first. Note that if you have a Temperature Compensation Measurement selected from the Options, this will overwrite the manual Temperature Compensation set here, so be sure to disable this option if you would like to specify the temperature to compensate with.

This input relies on an ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure pH and/or electrical conductivity (EC) from analog sensors. You can enable or disable either measurement if you want to only connect a pH sensor or an EC sensor by selecting which measurements you want to under Measurements Enabled. Select which channel each sensor is connected to on the ADC. There are default calibration values initially set for the Input. There are also functions to allow you to easily calibrate your sensors with calibration solutions. If you use the Calibrate Slot actions, these values will be calculated and will replace the currently-set values. You can use the Clear Calibration action to delete the database values and return to using the default values. If you delete the Input or create a new Input to use your ADC/sensors with, you will need to recalibrate in order to store new calibration data.

- Libraries: wiringpi, mir-one/PiPyADC-py3
- Dependencies: [wiringpi](https://pypi.org/project/wiringpi), [pipyadc_py3](https://github.com/mir-one/PiPyADC-py3)

This input relies on an ADS1256 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure pH and/or electrical conductivity (EC) from analog sensors. You can enable or disable either measurement if you want to only connect a pH sensor or an EC sensor by selecting which measurements you want to under Measurements Enabled. Select which channel each sensor is connected to on the ADC. There are default calibration values initially set for the Input. There are also functions to allow you to easily calibrate your sensors with calibration solutions. If you use the Calibrate Slot actions, these values will be calculated and will replace the currently-set values. You can use the Clear Calibration action to delete the database values and return to using the default values. If you delete the Input or create a new Input to use your ADC/sensors with, you will need to recalibrate in order to store new calibration data.

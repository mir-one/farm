There are several ways to visualize collected data.

## Live Measurements

Page\: `Data -> Live Measurements`

The `Live Measurements` page is the first page a user sees after logging in to Farm. It will display the current measurements being acquired from Input and Function controllers. If there is nothing displayed on the `Live` page, ensure an Input or Function controller is both configured correctly and activated. Data will be automatically updated on the page from the measurement database.

## Asynchronous Graphs

Page\: `Data -> Asynchronous Graphs`

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively long periods of time (weeks/months/years), which could be very data- and processor-intensive to view as a Synchronous Graph. Select a time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists. The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700 data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4 months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded. However, when viewing a 4 month span, it's not possible to see every data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only ~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which time only another ~50kb is downloaded.

!!! note
    Graphs require measurements, therefore at least one Input/Output/Function/etc. needs to be added and activated in order to display data.

## Dashboard

Page\: `Data -> Dashboard`

The dashboard can be used for both viewing data and manipulating the system, thanks to the numerous dashboard widgets available. Widgets are how data is presented to the user and how the user can control aspects of the system from the dashboard. These include graphs, gauges, indicators, and more. For a full list of supported Widgets, see [Supported Widgets](Supported-Widgets.md). Multiple dashboards can be created. Widgets can be moved and arranged on the dashboards by dragging and can be resized by pulling the bottom-left or bottom-right side of the widget.

### Custom Widgets

There is a Custom Widget import system in Farm that allows user-created Widgets to be used in the Farm system. Custom Widgets can be uploaded on the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Widgets` page. After import, they will be available to use on the `Setup -> Widget` page.

If you develop a working Widget module, please consider [creating a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=New%20Module) or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set.

Open any of the built-in modules located in the directory [Farm/farm/widgets](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/widgets/) for examples of the proper formatting.

There are also example Custom Widgets in the directory [Farm/farm/widgets/examples](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/widgets/examples)

Additionally, I have another github repository devoted to Custom Modules that are not included in the built-in set, at [mir-one/Farm-custom](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm-custom).

### Graph Widget

A graphical data display that is useful for viewing data sets spanning relatively short periods of time (hours/days/weeks). Select a time frame to view data and continually updating data from new sensor measurements. Multiple graphs can be created on one page that enables a dashboard to be created of graphed sensor data. Each graph may have one or more data from inputs, outputs, or PIDs rendered onto it. To edit graph options, select the plus sign on the top-right of a graph.

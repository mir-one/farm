Page\: `Setup -> Input`

For a full list of supported Inputs, see [Supported Input Devices](Supported-Inputs.md).

Inputs, such as sensors, ADC signals, or even a response from a command, enable measuring conditions in the environment or elsewhere, which will be stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB). This database will provide measurements for [Dashboards](Data-Viewing.md#dashboard), [LCDs](LCDs.md), [PID Controllers](Functions.md#pid-controller), [Conditional Statements](Functions.md#conditional), and other parts of Farm to operate from. Add, configure, and activate inputs to begin recording measurements to the database and allow them to be used throughout Farm.

### Custom Inputs

See [Building a Custom Input Module](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/wiki/Building-a-Custom-Input-Module) Wiki page.

There is a Custom Input import system in Farm that allows user-created Inputs to be created an used in the Farm system. Custom Inputs can be uploaded and imported from the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Inputs` page. After import, they will be available to use on the `Setup -> Input` page.

If you develop a working Input module, please consider [creating a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature-request.md&title=New%20Module) or pull request, and it may be included in the built-in set.

Open any of the built-in modules located in the directory [Farm/farm/inputs](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/inputs/) for examples of the proper formatting.

There are also example Custom Inputs in the directory [Farm/farm/inputs/examples](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm/tree/master/farm/inputs/examples)

Additionally, I have another github repository devoted to Custom Modules that are not included in the built-in set, at [mir-one/Farm-custom](https://github.com/mir-one/Farm-custom).

### Input Actions

Input Actions are functions within the Input module that can be executed from the Web UI. This is useful for things such as calibration or other functionality specific to the input. By default, there is at least one action, Acquire Measurements Now, which will cause the input to acquire measurements rather than waiting until the next Period has elapsed.

!!! note
    Actions can only be executed while the Input is active.

1.  [Debouncing a signal](https://mir.one/projects/2016/02/morse-code-translator.html#debouncing)

### The Things Network

[The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) (TTN) Input module enables downloading of data from TTN if the Data Storage Integration is enabled in your TTN Application. The Data Storage Integration will store data for up to 7 days. Farm will download this data periodically and store the measurements locally.

The payload on TTN must be properly decoded to variables that correspond to the "Variable Name" option under "Channel Options", in the lower section of the Input options. For instance, in your TTN Application, if a custom Payload Format is selected, the decoder code may look like this:

```javascript
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
    var decoded = {};
    var rawTemp = bytes[0] + bytes[1] * 256;
    decoded.temperature = sflt162f(rawTemp) * 100;
    return decoded;
}

function sflt162f(rawSflt16) {
    rawSflt16 &= 0xFFFF;
    if (rawSflt16 === 0x8000)
        return -0.0;
    var sSign = ((rawSflt16 & 0x8000) !== 0) ? -1 : 1;
    var exp1 = (rawSflt16 >> 11) & 0xF;
    var mant1 = (rawSflt16 & 0x7FF) / 2048.0;
    return sSign * mant1 * Math.pow(2, exp1 - 15);
}
```

This will decode the 2-byte payload into a temperature float value with the name "temperature". Set "Number of Measurements" to "1", then set the "Variable Name" for the first channel (CH0) to "temperature" and the "Measurement Unit" to "Temperature: Celsius (°C)".

Upon activation of the Input, data will be downloaded for the past 7 days. The latest data timestamp will be stored so any subsequent activation of the Input will only download new data (since the last known timestamp).

This Input also allows multiple measurements to be stored. You merely have to change "Number of Measurements" to a number larger than 1, save, and there will now be multiple variable names and measurement units to set.

There are several example Input modules that, in addition to storing the measurements of a sensor in the influx database, will write the measurements to a serial device. This is useful of you have a LoRaWAN transmitter connected via serial to receive measurement information from Farm and transmit it to a LoRaWAN gateway (and subsequently to The Things Network). The data on TTN can then be downloaded elsewhere with the TTN Input. These example Input modules are located in the following locations:

`~/Farm/farm/inputs/examples/bme280_ttn.py`

`~/Farm/farm/inputs/examples/k30_ttn.py`

For example, the following excerpt from `bme_280.py` will write a set of comma-separated strings to the user-specified serial device with the first string (the letter "B") used to denote the sensor/measurements, followed by the actual measurements (humidity, pressure, and temperature, in this case).

```python
string_send = 'B,{},{},{}'.format(
    return_dict[1]['value'],
    return_dict[2]['value'],
    return_dict[0]['value'])
self.serial_send = self.serial.Serial(self.serial_device, 9600)
self.serial_send.write(string_send.encode())
```

This is useful if multiple data strings are to be sent to the same serial device (e.g. if both `bme280_ttn.py` and `k30_ttn.py` are being used at the same time), allowing the serial device to distinguish what data is being received.

The full code used to decode both `bme280_ttn.py` and `k30_ttn.py`, with informative comments, is located at `~/Farm/farm/inputs/examples/ttn_data_storage_decoder_example.js`.

These example Input modules may be modified to suit your needs and imported into Farm through the `[Gear Icon] -> Configure -> Custom Inputs` page. After import, they will be available to use on the `Setup -> Input` page.

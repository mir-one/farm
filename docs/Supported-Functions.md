Supported Functions are listed below.

## Built-In Functions

### Backup to Remote Host (rsync)

- Dependencies: [rsync](https://packages.debian.org/buster/rsync)

This function will use rsync to back up assets on this system to a remote system. Your remote system needs to have an SSH server running and rsync installed. This system will need rsync installed and be able to access your remote system via SSH keyfile (login without a password). You can do this by creating an SSH key on this system running Farm with "ssh-keygen" (leave the password field empty), then run "ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@REMOTE_HOST_IP" to transfer your public SSH key to your remote system (changing pi and REMOTE_HOST_IP to the appropriate user and host of your remote system). You can test if this worked by trying to connect to your remote system with "ssh pi@REMOTE_HOST_IP" and you should log in without being asked for a password. Be careful not to set the Period too low, which could cause the function to begin running before the previous operation(s) complete. Therefore, it is recommended to set a relatively long Period (greater than 10 minutes). The default Period is 15 days. Note that the Period will reset if the system or the Farm daemon restarts and the Function will run, generating new settings and measurement archives that will be synced. There are two common ways to use this Function: 1) A short period (1 hour), only have Backup Camera Directories enabled, and use the Backup Settings Now and Backup Measurements Now buttons manually to perform a backup, and 2) A long period (15 days), only have Backup Settings and Backup Measurements enabled. You can even create two of these Functions with one set up to perform long-Period settings and measurement backups and the other set up to perform short-Period camera backups.

This is due to this Function running periodically- if it created a new backup every Period, there would soon be many identical backups. Therefore, if you want to induce the backup of settings, measurements, or camera directories and sync them to your remote system, use the buttons below.

### Bang-Bang Hysteretic (On/Off) (Raise/Lower)


A simple bang-bang control for controlling one output from one input. Select an input, an output, enter a setpoint and a hysteresis, and select a direction. The output will turn on when the input is below (lower = setpoint - hysteresis) and turn off when the input is above (higher = setpoint + hysteresis). This is the behavior when Raise is selected, such as when heating. Lower direction has the opposite behavior - it will try to turn the output on in order to drive the input lower.

### PID Autotune


This function will attempt to perform a PID controller autotune. That is, an output will be powered and the response measured from a sensor several times to calculate the P, I, and D gains. Updates about the operation will be sent to the Daemon log. If the autotune successfully completes, a summary will be sent to the Daemon log as well. Currently, only raising a Measurement is supported, but lowering should be possible with some modification to the function controller code. It is recommended to create a graph on a dashboard with the Measurement and Output to monitor that the Output is successfully raising the Measurement beyond the Setpoint. Note: Autotune is an experimental feature, it is not well-developed, and it has a high likelihood of failing to generate PID gains. Do not rely on it for accurately tuning your PID controller.

### Redundancy


This function stores the first available measurement. This is useful if you have multiple sensors that you want to serve as backups in case one stops working, you can set them up in the order of importance. This function will check if a measurement exits, starting with the first measurement. If it doesn't, the next is checked, until a measurement is found. Once a measurement is found, it is stored in the database with the user-set measurement and unit. The output of this function can be used as an input throughout Farm. If you need more than 3 measurements to be checked, you can string multiple Redundancy Functions by creating a second Function and setting the first Function's output as the second Function's input.
